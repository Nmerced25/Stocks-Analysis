# Stocks-Analysis

Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to expand the dataset over the last few years in order to help Steve gain a better picture on the stock trends. 
In order to build upon the previous knowlege, the code was refractored in order to loop through the entire dataset one time in a more effecient manner.
The code that was created deals with the years 2017 and 2018 while having the scrip loop through stock data by reading and storing the values from the rows from
each sheet. 


Results

When comparing the years 2017 to 2018 there shows a significant change in returns within those years. In 2017 shows to be the year where all the tickers except VSLR have 
made gains in their returns compared to 2018 where all but two tickers, ENPH and RUN, show a loss in return. Furthermore, within 2018 both tickers of ENPH and RUN have 
gained more than 80% of their total return in this year showing strides in their growth. In terms of the overall coding, the original script fell short to the 
refractored script by .021 seconds. This illustrates that the refractored script is able to analyze the data and provide the outcome in a more efficent manner when
timed against the original. When fully compared, the originial script when ran for both years is able to run in .546 seconds; whereas the refractored code can run the
same years in .039 seconds. 

Summary

After creating as well as refractoring the code for this assignment there does show some advantages and disadvantages as a practice. When it comes to the overall 
advantages of refractoring, it does allow for code to be edited and creates a new view for the programmer to come in and build upon what was previously created,
which in turn, can allow for more effiecncy and creativity when approaching a task. However, when it comes to the disadvanatages, new errors can arise which can create
bugs within the code that were not expected. 


When working on the project, the advantages of having the original code allowed for me to have all the values show at once which leads to the disadvantages 
which resulted in it being slgihtly slower than the refractored code. Overall, when setting it up I personally did not run into any major issues. In comparison to the 
refractored code, the advantage of it showed when it was able to pull up the information faster than the orginial. The disadavatages of refractoring code showed for me
when I had consistently ran into issues such as "overflow, compile errors, and run time errors". Each issue seemed to occur almost at every instence where I thought 
it was completed. Refractoring the code that was created took a total of two full days for me to complete, including office hours with a TA. For my instance this 
shows a major disadvatage since the result itself did not truly imply a significant difference in output when running the code for the data.
